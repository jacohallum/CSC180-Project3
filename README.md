# CSC180-Project3

Problem Formulation  
 
In this project, you practice with image classification using Google GPU and transfer learning.  
• Google Colaboratory is a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that is free to use and 
requires no setup. When you go to colab.research.google.com, TensorFlow is pre-installed. 
Just import tensorflow as tf, and start coding. 
• Transfer  learning  is  a  machine  learning  technique  where  pre-trained  models  are  used  as  
the  starting  point  on  computer  vision  and  natural  language  processing  tasks.  Transfer 
learning  is  an  optimization  that  allows  rapid  progress  or  improved  performance  when  
modeling the second task. 
The project is twofold: 
1. You train and test a CNN model on GPU without transfer learning 
2. You train and test a CNN model on GPU using transfer learning 
 
2.  Dataset 
We work with the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is preinstalled with Tensorflow. 
 
https://keras.io/datasets/ 
 
 
 
For more details, go to    https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 
 
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. 
There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.  
 
 
3.  Notebook 
 
Write your code to complete the provided notebook on the same Canvas page.  The notebook must 
be opened using Google Colab. 
 
How to launch notebooks using Google Colab:   
• To start working with Colab, you first need to log in to your google account, then go to this link  
https://colab.research.google.com 
• Go  to  the  folder  “Colab  Notebooks”  under  “My  Drive”  and  upload  the  notebook  file  there.    
Right click your notebook and open with “Google Colab”.
